    <h1>OMG! SLOTHS</h1>
    <h3>Sloths—the sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America—spend their lives in the tropical rain forests.
        They
        move through the canopy at a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves, twigs and buds. Sloths have an
        exceptionally low metabolic rate and spend 15 to 20 hours per day sleeping. And surprisingly enough, the
        long-armed
        animals are excellent swimmers. They occasionally drop from their treetop perches into water for a paddle.</h3>

                                What separates the maned sloth from other three-toed sloths is the lack of markings on
                                its
                                face.

                                brown fur surrounds a seemingly whimsical smile and gives the maned sloth its name.

                                and they that inhabit tropical rainforests in northern South America.

                                sloth, and is found in the forests of South and Central America.

                                although three clawed toes are on each of the hind feet.
