    <h1>OMG! SLOTHS</h1>
    <h3>Sloths—the sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America—spend their lives in the tropical rain forests.
        They
        move through the canopy at a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves, twigs and buds. Sloths have an
        exceptionally low metabolic rate and spend 15 to 20 hours per day sleeping. And surprisingly enough, the
        long-armed
        animals are excellent swimmers. They occasionally drop from their treetop perches into water for a paddle.</h3>

                    <p>
                        Classified as critically endangered, pygmy
                        three-toed sloths are native exclusively to the island of Escudo de Veragua, off the Caribbean
                        coast of Panama. The species is notably smaller than other species of sloths.

                        What separates the maned sloth from other three-toed sloths is the lack of markings on its face. Long, coarse solid
                        brown fur surrounds a seemingly whimsical smile and gives the maned sloth its name.

                        Pale-throated sloths are difficult to distinguish from the closely related brown-throated sloth, but, as their name implies, have a pale yellow patch on the throat and they that inhabit tropical rainforests in northern South America.
